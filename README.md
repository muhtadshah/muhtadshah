### ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with 4 years of experience in Web and App Development. I have a deep love for programming and enjoy building new and innovative projects.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I'm currently focused on building an Advanced Text Converter website and assistive apps. I'm using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and backend technologies to build the website and Kotlin to build android applications.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

I'm always learning and trying to keep up with the latest advancements in technology. Currently, I'm exploring GraphQL, a query language and runtime for APIs that allows me to request only the data I need and get predictable results. and I'm excited to see where it takes me.

Edit: I'm learning Python too :)
